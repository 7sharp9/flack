Flack is an F# based socket implementation for high speed high throughput applications, it is built on top of the SocketAsyncEventArgs pattern, this minimises memory fragmentation that is common in the IAsync pattern.

This project will later be integrated into frack: https://github.com/panesofglass/frack
