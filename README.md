Flack is an F# based socket implementation for high speed high throughput applications, it is built on top 
of the SocketAsyncEventArgs pattern, this minimises memory fragmentation that is common in the IAsync pattern.

This project later became a part of [fracture-IO][1].  I have left it here for posterity reasons and because 
of the links from the blog posts I wrote on the [subject][2].
